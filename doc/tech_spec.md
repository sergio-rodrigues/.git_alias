# Technical Specification

## Overview

The technical specification provides detailed information on the implementation and functionality of the SSH configuration management script.

## Architecture

- Written in Bash scripting language
- Relies on system utilities such as `route` and `awk` for network information retrieval
- Uses `sed` and `awk` for text processing and manipulation
- Integrates with Git commands for version control operations

## Components

- `git_alias.sh`: Main script responsible for configuring SSH settings
- `.env`: Environment variable file containing configuration parameters
- `config_file`: Configuration file for SSH settings

## Dependencies

- Bash shell environment
- Access to system utilities (`route`, `awk`, `sed`)
- `.env` file with required environment variables
- Configuration file (`config_file`) with SSH settings

## Usage

1. Run the main script (`git_alias.sh`) to configure SSH settings based on network conditions.
2. Ensure the `.env` file is present and contains the necessary environment variables.
3. Update the configuration file (`config_file`) with relevant SSH settings.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the configuration process.

## Configuration Examples

- Example `.env` file:

  ```
  CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config_file
  PROXY_CMD="/mingw64/bin/connect -H proxy.example.com:3128 %h %p"
  ```

- Example `config_file`:

  ```
  # SSH Configuration Examples

  # No proxy configuration
  192.168.1.1|

  # Proxy configuration
  10.0.0.1|proxy.example.com:3128
  ```
